    "No adjustments made here. Although I had to copy code and paste on new notebook(.ipynb). Did same for email_preprocess and edited the print statements as well as changing cross validation to model selection and 'r' to 'rb'. Downloaded as .py file, saved to the 'tools' directory before it could import correctly here. "
